# If we wanna do mathematical equations while coding you can do it by doing this

o=10
o=o+5
print (o)
#we can use
#+ for addition
#- for substraction
#* for multiplication
#% for getting remainder
#/ for division and getting answer in float
#// for division and getting integer
#** for getting exponent
#gives 15 as answer

r/=500#= assignment operator being used here
print(r)
#  and many more mathematical equations can be done
