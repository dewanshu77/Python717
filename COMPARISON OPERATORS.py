#COMPARISON OPERATORS ARE USED WHENEVER WE NEED TO COMPARE A VARIABLE  AND INTEGER OR PARTICULAR VALUE
#STEPS ARE LIKE THIS
#FIRST DECLARE THE VARIABLE  WITH A CERTAIN VALUE
#IMPLEMENT THE if FUNCTION THEN PUT THE VARIABLE AND COMPARE IT BY THE HELP OF COMPARISON OPERATORS(<,>,=<,>=,==,!=,etc.) with certain amount of value
#see all the functions implementing below
#code begis here(PERFECT).

#given,
#if the name is less than 3 characters long
#then print name must be at least 3 characters
#otherwise if it's more than 50 characters long

#otherwise
#print name looks good!
