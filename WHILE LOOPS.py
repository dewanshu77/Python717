#While loops
#While loop is used to repeat a function till the boolean value goes false
#used to make games and many more
#first set the variable then
#use the while function and use the comparison operators
#then print the value of variable set firstly
#then you can add the data in variable or do equation in such a way that you get  more numbers  printed on the screen
#then the numbers would start  from true boolean value and would stop upto last true boolean value because after that there would be a false boolean value
#understand more by the given solved example
#variable=something no.
#while condition
#.........upto the true boolean value
#code begins here

i=1
while i<=5:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
print('done')

#TO PRINT SEQUENCE OF STARS (COOL RIGHT)
#SO COOL CODE OF STARS BEGINS HERE
i=1
while i<=5:
    print("*"* i)
    i=i+1
print("done")
